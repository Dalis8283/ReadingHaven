Chapter 2: The Stranger's Story

Gabriel Thorne checked into the Millbrook Inn that evening, his presence already the subject of whispered conversations throughout the small town. Martha Henley, the inn's proprietor, was a woman who prided herself on knowing everyone's business, but the stranger remained frustratingly enigmatic.

"Lovely evening," she commented as she handed him the key to room seven, the inn's best accommodation. "We don't get many visitors this time of year."

"I imagine not," Gabriel replied, his fingers closing around the old brass key. "Tell me, Mrs. Henley, have you lived in Millbrook long?"

"All my life, Mr. Thorne. Born and raised here, just like my mother before me."

"Then perhaps you remember the Blackwood family?"

Martha's hand froze halfway to the guest register. The color drained from her face, and for a moment, Gabriel thought she might faint.

"Why... why would you ask about them?" she whispered.

"They took something that belonged to my family. I've come to retrieve it."

Martha's eyes darted toward the stairs, as if she wanted nothing more than to flee. "Mr. Thorne, some things are better left buried. The Blackwoods... what happened to them... it wasn't natural."

"What do you mean?"

Martha leaned closer, her voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "They practiced things. Dark things. The whole family was involved—parents, children, even the grandmother who lived with them. People said they could make things happen just by willing it. Crops would fail in fields they'd walked through. Animals would sicken and die. And the children..."

She shuddered, unable to continue.

"What about the children?" Gabriel pressed gently.

"They never aged properly. The youngest, little Sarah, looked exactly the same for five years running. And their eyes... Lord help me, their eyes were like looking into deep water at night. You couldn't see the bottom."

Gabriel absorbed this information without visible reaction. "And then they disappeared?"

"One night in October, 1973. The whole family, just... gone. But the house..." Martha's voice trailed off.

"What about the house?"

"It burned that same night. Burned from the inside out, they said. But here's the strange part—the fire department never got a call. Nobody saw smoke or flames. We just woke up the next morning to find it a pile of ash and charred timber."

Gabriel nodded slowly. "And no one investigated?"

"Oh, they tried. State police came, fire marshal, even some federal agents. But they all left with the same confused look, like they couldn't quite remember why they'd come in the first place."

As Gabriel climbed the stairs to his room, Martha called after him: "Mr. Thorne? Whatever the Blackwoods took from your family... are you sure it's worth the risk of getting it back?"

Gabriel paused at the top of the stairs, his hand resting on the banister. "Mrs. Henley, some things are worth any risk. Even if it means facing the darkness itself."
