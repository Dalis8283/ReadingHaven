In the year 2157, the line between magic and code had blurred beyond recognition. Maya Chen sat in her cramped apartment, fingers dancing across a holographic keyboard that shimmered with arcane symbols.

The Neural Web hummed around her, a vast network that connected every mind on Earth. But Maya was different. She could see the code beneath the magic, the algorithms that powered spells.

"Another system crash," her AI companion, Zephyr, materialized beside her. "The Mage Council is blaming hackers again."

Maya's eyes narrowed as she studied the error logs. "This isn't random. Someone's rewriting reality itself."

She pulled up the source code of a simple levitation spell, watching in horror as the parameters shifted in real-time. Someone with access to the Core was making changes to the fundamental laws of their world.

"We need to get to the Archive," Maya said, grabbing her neural interface headset. "Before whoever's doing this realizes we can see them."

The apartment around them flickered, walls becoming transparent for a moment before solidifying again. The glitches were getting worse.

"Maya," Zephyr's voice carried a note of urgency she'd never heard before. "Look at this."

A new window opened in her visual field, displaying lines of code that made her blood run cold. Someone wasn't just editing spells—they were rewriting the fundamental constants of physics itself.

Gravity: 9.81 m/s² → 9.79 m/s² → 9.77 m/s²

The value was decreasing in real-time.

"They're not trying to hack the system," Maya whispered. "They're trying to prove we're living in one."

As if responding to her words, a message appeared in the code:

// Hello, Maya. Ready to see how deep the rabbit hole goes?
// - The Architect

The apartment shuddered, and Maya felt the familiar sensation of falling that came with a system reboot. But this time, she wasn't sure if she would wake up in the same reality she'd fallen asleep in.

"Hold on," she told Zephyr as she initiated the connection to the Archive. "We're going to find out who's playing god with our world."

The last thing she saw before diving into the digital realm was her reflection in the dark window—and for just a moment, she could swear she saw lines of code scrolling across her own face.
