The stranger arrived on a Tuesday, which was unusual for Millbrook. Nothing interesting ever happened on Tuesdays in their small town, nestled between rolling hills and forgotten by the outside world.

Eleanor Hartwell first spotted him from her position behind the counter of Hartwell's General Store, where she'd spent the better part of thirty years watching the same faces come and go with the predictable rhythm of small-town life. But this face was different.

He was tall, perhaps in his forties, with silver threading through dark hair and eyes that seemed to hold stories from a dozen lifetimes. His clothes were well-made but worn, the kind that spoke of long journeys and distant places. A leather satchel hung across his shoulder, and he carried a walking stick carved with intricate symbols that Eleanor couldn't quite make out from her distance.

"Can I help you?" she called out as he approached the store, though something in his bearing suggested he was the sort of man who rarely needed help with anything.

"I hope so," he replied, his voice carrying a slight accent she couldn't place. "I'm looking for a place to stay for a few days. Perhaps a week. I understand there's an inn here?"

Eleanor nodded toward the white building across the square. "The Millbrook Inn. Martha runs it. She'll take good care of you." She paused, curiosity getting the better of her. "Are you passing through, or...?"

The stranger's smile was enigmatic. "I'm looking for someone. Someone who lived here a long time ago."

"How long ago?"

"Fifty years, perhaps more."

Eleanor frowned. Fifty years would put it back to the 1970s, when she was just a girl. "What's the name? I might know the family."

"Blackwood," he said, and Eleanor felt a chill run down her spine. "I'm looking for anyone who might remember the Blackwood family."

The name hung in the air between them like a ghost. Eleanor hadn't heard it spoken aloud in decades, though it still whispered through the town's collective memory like a half-remembered nightmare.

"The Blackwoods," she repeated slowly. "Now that's a name I haven't heard in a very long time."

"Then you knew them?"

Eleanor glanced around the empty store, then stepped closer to the counter. "Mister...?"

"Thorne. Gabriel Thorne."

"Mr. Thorne, the Blackwood family... they left town under rather mysterious circumstances. There was talk, you understand. Rumors."

Gabriel's eyes sharpened with interest. "What kind of rumors?"

Eleanor hesitated. She'd been barely sixteen when the Blackwoods disappeared, but she remembered the whispers, the way adults would stop talking when children entered the room, the way people would cross themselves when passing the old Blackwood house on Elm Street.

"Strange things happened around that family," she said finally. "Unexplained things. And then one day, they were just... gone. All of them. Left everything behind."

"Everything?"

"House, belongings, even their car was still in the driveway. It was like they just vanished into thin air."

Gabriel was quiet for a long moment, his fingers drumming against the counter. "And the house? Is it still there?"

"Oh yes, it's still there. Been empty all these years. The town's tried to sell it a dozen times, but..." She shrugged. "Well, let's just say it hasn't found any takers."

"I'd like to see it."

Eleanor studied his face, noting the determination in his eyes. "Mr. Thorne, if you don't mind me asking, what's your connection to the Blackwoods?"

Gabriel picked up his satchel and adjusted the strap across his shoulder. "They took something that belonged to my family. I've come to get it back."

As he turned to leave, Eleanor called after him. "Mr. Thorne? Be careful. That house... it has a reputation."

He paused at the door, looking back over his shoulder. "What kind of reputation?"

"The kind that keeps the local kids away, even on Halloween."

Gabriel's smile was grim. "Good. Then I won't be disturbed."

As the door closed behind him, Eleanor watched through the window as he crossed the square toward the inn. She had a feeling that Tuesday in Millbrook was about to become very interesting indeed.

And somewhere in the back of her mind, she could swear she heard the faint sound of wind chimes, though there wasn't a breath of wind in the air.
