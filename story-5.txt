The message came through the radio at 3:33 AM, a time when the boundary between worlds grows thin.

"Can anyone hear me? Please, if anyone is listening..."

Dr. Sarah Mitchell had been monitoring deep space communications for fifteen years, but she'd never heard anything like this. The signal was coming from a region of space that should have been empty—a void between galaxies where no stars shone.

"This is Dr. Mitchell at the Arecibo Observatory. I can hear you. What's your location?"

Static filled the channel for long minutes before the voice returned, weaker now, more distant.

"I don't know where I am. I was on the research vessel Prometheus. We were investigating the dark matter anomaly in Sector 7. Then... then everything went wrong."

Sarah's blood ran cold. The Prometheus had been lost three years ago, vanished without a trace during a routine survey mission.

"What's your name?" she asked, her voice barely steady.

"Commander... Commander James Harrison. But that's impossible. I've been drifting here for... for centuries. Or maybe minutes. Time doesn't work the same way in the void."

The signal began to fade, but Harrison's final words came through with crystal clarity:

"Don't come looking for us, Dr. Mitchell. Some places are meant to remain empty. Some silences should never be broken."

The radio fell silent, leaving Sarah alone with the terrible knowledge that somewhere in the vast emptiness between galaxies, the crew of the Prometheus was still out there, lost in a place where time had no meaning and rescue was impossible.

She reached for her logbook to record the transmission, but her hand froze as she noticed the date on her computer screen. It was three years ago—the exact day the Prometheus had disappeared.

The radio crackled once more: "Dr. Mitchell? Can you hear me? This is Commander Harrison. We're about to investigate the anomaly in Sector 7. Everything looks normal from here..."

Sarah stared at the radio in horror, realizing she wasn't receiving a message from the past. She was receiving a warning about the future—a future that was about to repeat itself in an endless loop of cosmic horror.

The void between galaxies wasn't empty after all. It was full of echoes, trapped souls, and time itself twisted into impossible shapes. And now, Sarah knew she had a choice: warn the Prometheus and break the cycle, or let fate take its course and preserve the timeline.

But as she reached for the transmitter, she realized the most terrifying truth of all: she had made this choice before, countless times, in an endless loop of her own.
