Chapter 3: Secrets in the Attic

The next morning, Gabriel made his way to Elm Street, where the Blackwood house had once stood. The lot was empty now, overgrown with weeds and wild grass, but he could still see the outline of the foundation beneath the vegetation.

He knelt and brushed away the debris, revealing blackened stones that still bore scorch marks after fifty years. As his fingers traced the ancient symbols carved into the foundation stones, he felt a familiar tingle of recognition.

"I thought I might find you here."

Gabriel turned to see an elderly man approaching, leaning heavily on a walking cane. Despite his age, his eyes were sharp and alert.

"I'm sorry, do we know each other?" Gabriel asked, rising to his feet.

"Name's Henry Blackwood," the old man said, extending a gnarled hand. "I'm the only one left."

Gabriel's eyes widened. "You'reâ€”"

"The youngest son. I was away at college when it happened. Came back to find my family gone and my home burned to the ground." Henry's voice carried decades of pain. "I've been waiting fifty years for someone like you to show up."

"Someone like me?"

"Someone who knows what we really were. What we really did." Henry gestured toward the ruined foundation. "My family weren't practitioners of dark magic, Mr. Thorne. We were guardians. Protectors. We kept something locked away that should never see the light of day."

Gabriel felt his pulse quicken. "The Obsidian Mirror."

Henry nodded grimly. "So you do know. Your family sent you, didn't they? The Thornes were always the other half of the equation. Light and shadow, order and chaos, keeping the balance."

"The mirror was stolen from us three generations ago. My great-grandfather died trying to get it back."

"And my family died trying to keep it safe." Henry's eyes grew distant. "But we failed. On the night we disappeared, something broke through our defenses. Something that had been hunting the mirror for centuries."

"What happened to your family?"

Henry was quiet for a long moment, staring at the blackened stones. "They made the ultimate sacrifice. They bound themselves to the mirror, became part of its prison. The fire you heard about? That was them, burning away their physical forms to strengthen the magical bonds."

Gabriel felt a chill run down his spine. "Then they're still..."

"Still guarding it, yes. Trapped between life and death, holding back something that could unmake reality itself." Henry looked up at Gabriel with haunted eyes. "And now it's stirring again. The bonds are weakening. That's why you're here, isn't it? You can feel it calling."

Gabriel nodded reluctantly. "The dreams started six months ago. Visions of a black mirror that shows not reflections, but possibilities. Futures that should never come to pass."

"Then we don't have much time," Henry said, turning toward the old oak tree at the edge of the property. "The mirror isn't destroyed. It's hidden. And I'm the only one left who knows where."
