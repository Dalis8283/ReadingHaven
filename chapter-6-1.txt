Chapter 1: Stolen Moments

Kira's fingers trembled as she attached the neural extractor to her temple. In the black market of Neo-Tokyo, memories were currency, and she was about to make a withdrawal from her own mind.

"First time?" asked the dealer, a thin man with cybernetic eyes that glowed blue in the dim light.

Kira nodded, unable to speak. She needed the money—her sister's medical bills wouldn't pay themselves. But selling memories meant losing pieces of herself forever.

"What are you offering?" the dealer continued, his scanner analyzing the neural patterns flowing from her brain.

"My seventh birthday," Kira whispered. "The day my father taught me to ride a bike."

The scanner beeped, and the dealer's expression shifted to one of interest. "Pure joy, untainted by later trauma. This is premium stock. I can offer you fifty thousand credits."

As the extraction began, Kira felt the memory being pulled from her mind like a thread being unraveled. The sensation of her father's hands steadying the bicycle, his encouraging voice, the triumph of her first solo ride—all of it flowing away into the machine.

When it was over, she tried to remember why bicycles made her feel sad, but the connection was gone forever.

Outside the memory clinic, Kira walked through the neon-lit streets of the underground district, her pocket heavy with credits but her heart strangely empty. She passed other memory sellers—hollow-eyed people who had traded away so much of themselves that they barely remembered who they used to be.

"Kira Nakamura?" A voice called from the shadows.

She turned to see a woman in an expensive suit, her augmented reality contacts glowing softly in the darkness.

"My name is Dr. Elena Vasquez. I represent certain interests who are very concerned about the memory trade. We'd like to offer you a job."

"What kind of job?"

"The kind that might help you get your memories back."

Kira stared at the woman, hope and suspicion warring in her chest. In a world where memories could be stolen, sold, and traded like commodities, the promise of recovery seemed too good to be true.

But what choice did she have? She had already lost so much, and her sister still needed help.

"What do you want me to do?"

Dr. Vasquez smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "We want you to steal memories from someone who has been stealing them from others. Someone who has built an empire on other people's pain."

"And in return?"

"In return, we'll give you back everything you've lost. Every memory, every moment, every piece of yourself that you've sold."

Kira looked back at the memory clinic, then at the woman offering her a chance at redemption.

"When do we start?"
