# The Last Bookbinder

The workshop smelled of leather and old paper, a scent that had become as rare as the craft itself. Thomas ran his weathered fingers along the spine of what would be the last book he'd ever bind.

Outside, the city hummed with the electric pulse of digital life. Screens flickered in every window, tablets glowed in every hand, and the great libraries had long since been converted into server farms.

But here, in this forgotten corner of the old quarter, Thomas continued his work as his father had taught him, and his father's father before that.

## The Question

"Why do you persist?" his granddaughter had asked him just last week, her voice tinged with the impatience of youth. "No one reads physical books anymore."

Thomas had smiled then, the same smile he wore now as he pressed the final page into place.

## The Answer

"Because," he had told her, "when the lights go out and the servers fail, when the electromagnetic storms come and wipe clean all our digital dreams, these will remain."

He held up the book—a collection of essential knowledge, carefully curated and lovingly bound. Seeds and soil, water purification, basic medicine, the movements of stars.

"Books don't need batteries, child. They don't need networks or updates. They just need someone who remembers how to read."

## The Legacy

As if summoned by his thoughts, she appeared in the doorway now, her tablet dark and useless in her hands.

"Grandfather," she said, her voice small. "The networks are down. Everything's gone dark. Can you... can you teach me?"

Thomas smiled and patted the chair beside his workbench.

"Sit, child. Let me show you how to bind more than just pages—how to bind knowledge itself to the world."

And so, in the flickering candlelight, the ancient craft lived on, passed from weathered hands to eager ones, ensuring that some stories would survive no matter what storms might come.
