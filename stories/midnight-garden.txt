Sarah had always been a light sleeper, but tonight was different. The old grandfather clock in the hallway chimed twelve times, each note seeming to hang in the air longer than usual.

She slipped out of bed and padded to the window, drawn by an inexplicable pull. The backyard, usually a mundane patch of grass and her mother's struggling vegetable garden, had transformed.

Where once stood wilted tomato plants, now bloomed flowers that seemed to glow with their own inner light. Roses the size of dinner plates climbed impossible spirals into the sky, their petals shifting through colors that had no names.

"Welcome," whispered a voice like wind through leaves.

Sarah turned to find a woman made of starlight and shadow, her dress woven from moonbeams and midnight.

"I've been waiting for you," the woman continued. "This garden exists between heartbeats, between the tick and tock of time. Here, every dream you've ever forgotten grows into something beautiful."

As Sarah stepped into the garden, she felt years of worry and doubt fall away like autumn leaves. In this place, she remembered what it felt like to believe in magic.

The flowers whispered secrets of distant worlds, and the trees bore fruit that tasted like childhood summers and first love. Time moved like honey here, sweet and slow.

When dawn approached, the garden began to fade, but the woman pressed a single seed into Sarah's palm.

"Plant this in your heart," she said. "And remember—magic is always just a heartbeat away."

As the first rays of sunlight touched the window, Sarah found herself back in her room, the seed warm in her palm. She planted it in a small pot on her windowsill, and every night thereafter, when the clock struck twelve, she would see the garden bloom again—not in her backyard, but in her dreams, where magic lives forever.
