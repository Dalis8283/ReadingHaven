Chapter 2: The Collector

Detective Ray Nakamura had seen enough memory crimes to know that this case was different. The victim, a wealthy businessman named Tanaka, sat in the interview room with the blank stare of someone who had lost more than just a few recollections.

"Tell me what you remember about last Tuesday," Ray said gently.

Tanaka's brow furrowed in concentration. "I... I know I went to work. But I can't remember anything else. It's like there's a hole in my mind."

Ray had seen selective memory theft before—criminals would steal specific memories to cover their tracks. But this was wholesale extraction. Someone had taken an entire day from Tanaka's life.

"We found this at your office," Ray said, sliding a small device across the table. It was a high-end neural scanner, military grade.

Tanaka stared at it blankly. "I've never seen it before."

But Ray knew better. The device was registered to Tanaka himself, purchased just two weeks ago. Someone hadn't just stolen the man's memories—they'd made him forget he'd bought the tools for his own mental robbery.

As Ray left the interview room, his partner Chen was waiting with a grim expression.

"We found three more victims," Chen said. "All wealthy, all missing the same day from their memories. And Ray... they all bought identical neural scanners two weeks ago."

Ray felt a chill run down his spine. Someone was playing a much larger game than simple memory theft. Someone was collecting specific memories from specific people, and they were making their victims complicit in their own mental violation.

"There's something else," Chen continued. "I ran the serial numbers on the scanners. They were all purchased by the same shell company—Mnemonic Solutions."

"Never heard of them."

"That's because they don't officially exist. But I did some digging. The company is registered to a Dr. Marcus Voss, a neuroscientist who was kicked out of the university five years ago for unethical experiments."

Ray's blood ran cold. He knew that name—not from police files, but from somewhere much more personal. Somewhere in his own memories, though he couldn't quite place it.

"Chen, I need you to run a background check on Dr. Voss. Everything you can find. And I want to know if there's any connection between him and the victims."

As Chen walked away, Ray tried to remember where he'd heard the name Marcus Voss before. But every time he reached for the memory, it slipped away like smoke, leaving him with nothing but a growing sense of dread.

Someone was stealing memories on an industrial scale, and Ray had the terrible feeling that he might be next on their list.

The question was: what memories were so valuable that someone would risk everything to steal them? And why couldn't Ray shake the feeling that he already knew the answer?
